The central feature of this gene family equal a novel, highly conserved DNA - binding motif, known as the paired box. Paired box arrangement factors are important regulators in early development, and revision in the expression of their genes are thought to contribute to neoplastic transformation. This gene encodes the B - cell lineage specific activator protein that is expressed at early, but not late stages of B - cell differentiation.

This gene is located at 9p13, which is involved in t (9; 14) (p13; q32) translocations recurring in small lymphocytic lymphomas of the plasmacytoid subtype, and in derived large - cell lymphomas. This translocation brings the potent E - mu enhancer of the IgH gene into close proximity of the PAX5 promoter, suggesting that the deregulation of arranging of this gene contributes to the pathogenesis of these lymphomas. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encode different isoforms.

Both domains are known to bind DNA and subprogram as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the development of neural tissues, particularly the eye.

The central feature of this gene family is a novel, highly conserved DNA-binding motif, known as the paired box. Paired box transcription factors are important regulators in early development, and alterations in the expression of their genes are thought to contribute to neoplastic transformation. This gene encodes the B-cell lineage specific activator protein that is expressed at early, but not late stages of B-cell differentiation. Its expression has also been detected in developing CNS and testis and so the encoded protein may also play a role in neural development and spermatogenesis. This gene is located at 9p13, which is involved in t(9;14)(p13;q32) translocations recurring in small lymphocytic lymphomas of the plasmacytoid subtype, and in derived large-cell lymphomas. This translocation brings the potent E-mu enhancer of the IgH gene into close proximity of the PAX5 promoter, suggesting that the deregulation of transcription of this gene contributes to the pathogenesis of these lymphomas.

In addition to a conserved paired box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also contains a homeobox domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the development of neural tissues, specially the eye. This gene is regulated by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this locus. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular disorders such as aniridia and Peter ' s anomaly. Use of alternate promoter and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variant encoding different isoforms. Interestingly, inclusion of a special alternate coding exon has been shown to increase the length of the paired box domain and alter its DNA binding specificity. Therefore, isoforms that carry the shorter paired box domain regulate a different set of genes compared to the isoforms carrying the longer paired boxwood domain.

In addition to a conserved paired box domain, a hallmark feature of this gene family, the encoded protein also contains a homeobox gene domain. Both domains are known to bind DNA and function as regulators of gene transcription. Activity of this protein is key in the development of neural tissues, particularly the eye. This gene is regulated by multiple enhancers located up to hundreds of kilobases distant from this locale. Mutations in this gene or in the enhancer regions can cause ocular disorders such as aniridia and Peter ' s anomaly. Use of alternate promoters and alternative splice results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Interestingly, inclusion of a particular alternate coding exon has been shown to increase the length of the paired box domain and alter its DNA binding specificity. Consequently, isoforms that carry the shorter copulate box domain regulate a different set of genes compared to the isoforms carrying the longer paired box domain.
